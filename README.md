# raw-test-git

This blog project is running on my local machine with Eleventy v0.12.1 and Node v14.16.1

---

Purpose of this project:

I have two separate directories, one is /sights/ the other one is /sounds/. I want to run them indipendetly, each one with its own tags.

I want Eleventy to build:

/sights/tags/(all tags for sights);

/sounds/tags/(all tags for sounds).

But instead I get:

/sights/tags/(all tags for sights and sounds);

/sounds/tags/(all tags for sounds and sights).

Raymond Camden (Thank you very much Raymond), noticed that both tags pages are still paginating over collections, not collections.sights or collections.sounds;
once I've tried to resolve the pagination as above - which is the right change - I get errors.

Raymond noticed that this is because it's exposing another error: the issue is that permalink, as I have it, cannot use dynamic data like that,
and he suggested a workaround: to use eleventyComputed to define the permalink (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-computed/#using-a-template-string).

After several attempts there are still errors. Is clear that the problem is my incompetence in how to remove the dynamic value from the front matter.
